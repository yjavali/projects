# **E-Commerce Website Hosting on Azure**

## **Introduction**

This project was undertaken during an internship as a **Project Intern on Microsoft Azure at Verzeo** in **August 2019**. It demonstrates the deployment of a robust and scalable **WordPress website** hosted on **Microsoft Azure**. By leveraging Azure's Virtual Machines (VMs), DNS Zones, and third-party domain registration, the project highlights the integration of cloud infrastructure with a fully functional **eCommerce platform** for gifting, named **TheGiftMasters.ml**.

The presentation for this project is publicly available at [Hosting a WordPress Website on Microsoft Azure](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/word-press-website-on-azure-232241506/232241506).

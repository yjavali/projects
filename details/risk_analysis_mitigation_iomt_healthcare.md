## **Controls Based on Standards**

### **Governance and Policy Controls**
1. **Policy Framework:**  
   - Develop IoMT-specific cybersecurity policies, ensuring they cover onboarding, maintenance, and decommissioning of devices (**IEC 80001-1**).
   - Enforce regular policy updates to align with evolving compliance standards (**ISO/IEC 27001**).

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**  
   - Conduct quarterly compliance audits against GDPR Article 32 and ISO/IEC 27001 controls.
   - Use risk assessment templates to evaluate vulnerabilities before deployment.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities:**  
   - Assign a dedicated Medical IT Network Risk Manager to oversee risk management and stakeholder coordination (**IEC 80001-1**).

---

### **Access and Identity Management**
1. **RBAC Implementation:**  
   - Define granular roles for device users and administrators based on device functionality (**ISO/IEC 27001 A.9**).
   - Enforce strict access rights to prevent privilege escalation attacks (**NIST CSF Protect**).

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
   - Implement MFA for all administrative accounts, with biometric options for critical actions (**GDPR Article 32**).

3. **Credential Security:**  
   - Remove all default credentials from devices before deployment.
   - Use strong, unique passwords managed through an enterprise-grade password manager (**OWASP Recommendations**).

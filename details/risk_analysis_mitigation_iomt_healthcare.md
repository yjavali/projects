# **Risk Analysis and Mitigation for IoMT Devices in Healthcare**

## **Introduction**

This project investigates the vulnerabilities and risks associated with Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices in healthcare delivery organisations (HDOs). The study focuses on establishing a robust **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** framework while addressing the security requirements under **Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**. The project incorporates international standards, regulatory compliance, and practical risk mitigation strategies for a secure IoMT ecosystem.

## **Governance and Compliance Framework**

### **Applicable Standards and Frameworks**
1. **IEC 80001-1:2021**  
   - Establishes a lifecycle risk management approach for IT networks incorporating IoMT devices.
   - Emphasises collaboration between stakeholders via a designated Medical IT Network (MITN) Risk Manager.

2. **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**  
   - Provides guidelines for establishing and maintaining an ISMS for IoMT devices.
   - Includes control domains such as access management, incident response, and continuous monitoring.

3. **GDPR and Data Protection Act (DPA):**  
   - Ensures data privacy and protection, focusing on Article 32 requirements for securing sensitive health data.

4. **OWASP Secure Medical Device Deployment Standard v2.0**  
   - Recommends secure deployment practices, including firmware updates, secure configuration, and encrypted communication.

## **Risk Analysis and Information Security**

### **Risk Register and Vulnerability Assessment**
A detailed risk register was developed, highlighting vulnerabilities and proposed mitigations for IoMT devices:

| **Device**                          | **Risk**                       | **Impact (C-I-A)**        | **Mitigation Strategies**                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Welch Allyn Connex Central Station | Firmware tampering             | Critical                  | Enable secure boot, network segmentation, and apply regular patches.       |
| MiniMed Insulin Pump                | Authentication bypass          | High                      | Enforce RBAC, remove default credentials, and implement encrypted sessions.|
| Medtronic MyCareLink                | Unencrypted communication      | Critical                  | Use TLS 1.3, apply secure firmware updates, and configure secure VPNs.     |
| Natus EEG with NeuroWorks           | Buffer overflow                | Critical                  | Implement secure coding practices, apply DEP, and use IDS for detection.   |

### **Threat Modelling and STRIDE Analysis**
1. **Spoofing:**  
   - Attackers impersonate legitimate devices to inject malicious commands.
   - Mitigation: Two-way authentication and mutual TLS for secure connections.
   
2. **Tampering:**  
   - Firmware or configuration tampering leads to unauthorised behaviour.  
   - Mitigation: Implement cryptographic hashes for integrity validation.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  
   - Overloading IoMT device networks disrupts healthcare delivery.  
   - Mitigation: Apply rate-limiting, network redundancy, and IDS.

4. **Information Disclosure:**  
   - Interception of unencrypted health data during transmission.  
   - Mitigation: Enforce end-to-end encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3).

5. **Elevation of Privilege:**  
   - Exploiting software vulnerabilities for unauthorised access.  
   - Mitigation: Enforce role-based access controls and apply regular patching.

## **Proposed Mitigation Strategies**

### **Governance Controls**
- **Policy Development:**  
  Establish IoMT-specific cybersecurity policies, integrating incident response protocols and regular audits.
- **Security Audits:**  
  Perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify gaps.

### **Access and Identity Management**
- Enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** aligned with the Principle of Least Privilege.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access, incorporating biometric methods for high-risk actions.

### **Data Protection Measures**
- **Encryption Standards:**  
  - Apply AES-256 for data at rest.
  - Use TLS 1.3 for secure transmission, preventing eavesdropping and replay attacks.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  
  - Implement DLP solutions to monitor and prevent unauthorised data exfiltration.

## **Information Security Incident Management**

### **Incident Response Planning**
1. **Preparation:**  
   - Maintain an inventory of IoMT devices and associated vulnerabilities.  
   - Configure Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for proactive monitoring.

2. **Detection and Containment:**  
   - Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and mitigate abnormal activity in real-time.  
   - Isolate impacted devices using VLANs and segment critical networks.

3. **Recovery:**  
   - Conduct root cause analysis and apply corrective measures.  
   - Restore device functionality through verified backups and firmware integrity checks.

## **Learning Outcomes**

1. Gained expertise in aligning IoMT device risk management with IEC 80001 and ISO/IEC 27001 frameworks.
2. Enhanced skills in threat modelling using STRIDE and developing actionable risk registers.
3. Strengthened understanding of secure deployment practices and regulatory compliance.
4. Improved incident response planning and recovery strategies tailored to healthcare environments.

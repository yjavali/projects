## **Motivation**

The exponential growth of e-commerce platforms has intensified the need for secure handling of sensitive data. Multi-cloud architectures, while offering scalability and redundancy, introduce significant cyber security risks, such as data breaches, unauthorised access, and compliance failures. Homomorphic encryption emerges as a vital tool to address these issues, enabling computations on encrypted data and protecting it against malicious actors.

This research is motivated by:
1. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats in cloud ecosystems.
2. The critical balance between data utility and cyber security.
3. The need for regulatory compliance and innovative privacy-preserving solutions.

## **Key Features**

1. **Homomorphic Encryption:** Safeguards data integrity and confidentiality by allowing encrypted computations.
2. **Cyber Resilience in Multi-Clouds:** Reduces attack surfaces by leveraging distributed systems with secure encryption.
3. **GDPR Compliance:** Implements robust security controls to ensure data protection aligns with European regulations.
4. **Secure Analytics Pipeline:** Performs secure and accurate analysis without exposing sensitive data.
5. **Threat Mitigation:** Incorporates threat modelling and risk assessment frameworks to identify and mitigate cyber risks.

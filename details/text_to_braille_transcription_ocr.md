# Project: Transcriber for Visually Impaired

## **Overview**

### **Objective:**  
To design and implement a device that captures printed text and converts it into Braille script, enabling visually impaired individuals to access information more effectively.

**Specialist Field:** Assistive Technologies  
**Submission Date:** Academic Year 2018-2019  

The project was conceived to address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in accessing printed text. The Transcriber device bridges the gap by enabling real-time conversion of printed material into Braille, using advanced image processing and embedded systems.

## **Motivation**

The inspiration for this project emerged from a survey conducted at the School for the Blind, Navanagar, Hubballi. The survey revealed the scarcity of Braille-based resources and the dependency on human translators for visually impaired individuals to access knowledge. This highlighted the need for an affordable, standalone device to enhance their learning and communication capabilities.

## **System Design and Methodology**

### **Functional Block Diagram:**
The system consists of the following major components:
- **Camera Module:** Captures the image of the printed text.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Processes the captured image to extract text.
- **Microcontroller:** Converts ASCII characters into Braille script.
- **Braille Display:** Outputs the converted Braille script in real-time.

### **Hardware Components:**
1. **Raspberry Pi:** Central processing unit for image processing and Braille conversion.
2. **MAGPI Camera Module:** High-resolution camera for image capture.
3. **Tesseract OCR Engine:** Used for extracting text from images.
4. **Braille Display Unit:** Converts text into raised Braille characters using actuators.
5. **Power Supply:** 5.1V @ 2.5A for Raspberry Pi and connected peripherals.

### **Software Workflow:**
1. Capture an image using the camera module.
2. Process the image with Tesseract OCR to extract text.
3. Convert extracted text into ASCII format.
4. Map ASCII characters to corresponding Braille patterns.
5. Display the Braille patterns on the Braille display unit.
